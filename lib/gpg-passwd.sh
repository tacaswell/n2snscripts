# gpg-passwd.sh — Decrypt GPG-encrypted env files into the current shell.
#
# Provides:
#   decrypt_env_file <gpg_file> [required_var ...]
#       Decrypt a gpg-encrypted env file and eval its contents in the
#       current shell. When required vars are listed, verify they are
#       non-empty after the eval.
#
#       Returns:
#         0 - success, or file is unreadable (warning emitted; caller may
#             continue)
#         2 - decrypt succeeded but a required variable is still unset
#             or empty (also returned when gpg_file argument is missing)
#         3 - gpg decrypt failed
#         4 - eval of decrypted content failed (syntax error or failing
#             command)
#
# Usage (in a caller script):
#   # Source the library by its installed path; substitute the correct
#   # path for the deployment layout.
#   # shellcheck source=/dev/null
#   source <path-to>/n2snscripts/lib/gpg-passwd.sh
#   decrypt_env_file "$HOME/.zshrc.private.gpg" AIFAPIM_HOST AIFAPIM_API_KEY
#
# Calling convention under `set -e`:
#   decrypt_env_file runs `gpg` in a command substitution. Under a caller's
#   `set -e`, a non-zero exit from that command substitution can abort the
#   caller *before* it observes the function's return code, so the documented
#   return 3 (and return 2/0) are only reliably visible when the call is
#   guarded. Always capture the status explicitly, e.g.:
#       rc=0
#       decrypt_env_file "$HOME/.private.gpg" AIFAPIM_HOST || rc=$?
#       case "$rc" in ... esac
#   The trailing `|| rc=$?` both captures the code and suppresses `set -e`.
#
# Portability:
#   Works in both bash and zsh. Required-variable values are read by
#   indirection through `eval "value=\${$name:-}"`; the name is first
#   validated to be a plain shell identifier (and rejected if it starts with
#   the reserved __gpgpw_ prefix), so the eval can neither inject code nor
#   read one of this function's own locals. A `local -n` nameref would be the
#   bash idiom, but namerefs do not exist in zsh and this library is sourced
#   from both bash and zsh startup files.

# Guard against double-sourcing.

# All function-local variables are prefixed `__gpgpw_` so the eval indirection
# below cannot read one of this function's own locals when a caller passes a
# required-var name that collides with a local. Required-var names that
# themselves start with `__gpgpw_`, or that are not plain shell identifiers,
# are rejected (return 2) to close the residual collision and injection risks.
